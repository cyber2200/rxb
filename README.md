React-Redux sample code that shows how to created secured routes using server side validation and multi languages in a very simple way.

* Assuming you have npm and Mongo alreay installed.

1. Clone!
2. Open screen or use any other way to run the client and the server simultaneously.
3. Go into the "client" folder and run "npm install" and "npm start"
4. Go into the "server" folder and run "npm install and "npm start"

If you want to create a production build on some point you will need to run "npm run build" in the "client" folder and on production run only the server. The "server" app (Express.js) will server the client files as static files and will function as a backend.
For the devleopment it make no sense since there is no hot reloader and you will need to build on every chnage.
